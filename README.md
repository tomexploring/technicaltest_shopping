#Technical Test Outline

- Build domain objects (UI not required) to model a shopping cart system with the following
  acceptance criteria:
- Multiple products can be purchased in a single basket. (the products can be whatever you wish)
- Products should belong to a Category
  We also want to support the following discounts/promotions:
- A general basket % discount (eg 10% off total basket)
- A discount for a specific product (eg 20% off all apples)
- A buy 2 get 1 free promotion (eg buy 2 apples, get 3rd apple free)
- A combination purchase deal (eg buy 1 sandwich and 1 apple and 1 drink for Â£X price)

Only one discount can be applied to a product.  
For example: if a product is included in a meal deal or buy 2 get 1 free promotion then it should
not also be discounted with a general basket discount.

Please use **Kotlin** as the programming language and include unit tests, please also try to be
aware of edge cases you might need to consider.

This is a general engineering test so giving thought to maintainability and extensibility is key.
